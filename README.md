## Planet Nine Evolution Hypothesis

A physics-based hypothesis exploring how an additional ice-giant–mass planet may
have influenced the early dynamical evolution of the outer solar system.

---

## Overview

The Planet Nine Evolution Hypothesis proposes that an additional ice-giant–mass
planet existed during the early stages of the solar system and played a role in
shaping its present structure.

Planet Nine was likely between five and ten times the mass of Earth. Numerical
simulations of early planetary systems commonly produce such planets, many of
which are later removed during periods of dynamical instability.

## Early Solar System Instability

During the early chaotic phase of solar system evolution, strong gravitational
interactions between Jupiter and Saturn destabilized the outer planetary region.
These interactions triggered large-scale scattering events that transferred
significant orbital energy among the giant planets.

As a result of these encounters, Planet Nine was scattered outward from its
original orbit.

---

## Scattering and Orbital Evolution

Rather than escaping immediately, Planet Nine followed a curved trajectory under
the Sun’s gravitational influence. Because its velocity remained slightly below
solar escape speed, the planet stayed weakly bound to the solar system.

This process naturally produced a highly elongated orbit characterized by
extreme eccentricity and a very large semi-major axis, resulting in orbital
periods ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of years. Such long-period
bound orbits are commonly observed in numerical scattering simulations.

## Influence on Neptune

While moving through the outer solar system, Planet Nine continued to interact
gravitationally with the known giant planets. Repeated long-range perturbations
altered the orbital evolution of Neptune and contributed to Neptune’s outward
migration during this early stage.

These effects accumulated over long timescales, even though individual
interactions were weak.

---

## Stabilization Phase

As the solar system evolved, the surrounding planetesimal disk was gradually
depleted and close encounters between the giant planets became increasingly
rare.

Once Planet Nine’s perihelion distance shifted sufficiently far from Neptune,
strong gravitational interactions ceased and its orbit became dynamically
stable.

---

## Long-Term Outcomes

Following stabilization, two physically allowed evolutionary paths exist:

- Planet Nine may have remained on a distant, frozen orbit for billions of years.
- Alternatively, later perturbations could have eventually supplied enough
  energy for complete ejection from the solar system.

Both outcomes are commonly produced in long-term dynamical simulations.

## Present-Day Detectability

If Planet Nine still exists today, it would be extremely difficult to detect due
to its immense distance from the Sun, very low temperature, dark surface
properties, and exceptionally slow apparent motion across the sky.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents a conceptual and computational exploration of early
outer solar system evolution.

The project is intended for learning, discussion, and long-term development.
It does not claim discovery, but serves as a structured hypothesis supported by
known physical principles.
